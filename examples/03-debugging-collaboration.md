  Our Node.js service has a memory leak - heap grows unbounded.
  I've profiled it and see a lot of closures being retained.

  The service processes jobs from a queue. Each job handler:
  1. Fetches data from API
  2. Transforms it
  3. Saves to database

  Heap snapshot shows thousands of pending HTTP requests.
  Any ideas what might be wrong?

  Thousands of pending HTTP requests suggests you're not:
  1. Properly handling request timeouts
  2. Closing connections
  3. Limiting concurrent requests

  **Common causes:**

  1. **No timeout** - Requests hang forever if API is slow
  2. **No connection pool limits** - Creating unlimited connections
  3. **Missing error handlers** - Uncaught promise rejections keep references
  4. **Event listener leaks** - Not removing listeners after request completes

  Can you share your HTTP client setup and job handler code?
  That will help pinpoint the issue.

  Here's the job handler:

  async function processJob(job) {
    const data = await fetch(`https://api.example.com/data/${job.id}`);
    const json = await data.json();
    const transformed = transform(json);
    await db.save(transformed);
  }

  queue.on('job', async (job) => {
    await processJob(job);
  });

  We're using node-fetch and processing ~1000 jobs/minute.

  Found it! Multiple issues:

  **Critical:** No error handling - if fetch or db.save fails,
  the promise chain breaks but references remain in memory.

  **Critical:** No timeout - if API is slow, requests accumulate.

  **Critical:** No concurrency limit - at 1000 jobs/min, you could
  have hundreds of concurrent requests overwhelming your event loop.

  **Fix:**

  1. Add error handling:
    queue.on('job', async (job) => {
      try {
        await processJob(job);
      } catch (err) {
        logger.error('Job failed', { jobId: job.id, error: err });
        // Don't rethrow - let it complete
      }
    });

  2. Add timeout to fetch:
    const controller = new AbortController();
    const timeout = setTimeout(() => controller.abort(), 5000);

    try {
      const data = await fetch(url, { signal: controller.signal });
      return await data.json();
    } finally {
      clearTimeout(timeout);
    }

  3. Limit concurrency with p-limit:
    import pLimit from 'p-limit';
    const limit = pLimit(10); // Max 10 concurrent jobs

    queue.on('job', async (job) => {
      await limit(() => processJob(job));
    });

  4. Use connection pooling with node-fetch:
    import fetch from 'node-fetch';
    import http from 'http';
    import https from 'https';

    const httpAgent = new http.Agent({ maxSockets: 50 });
    const httpsAgent = new https.Agent({ maxSockets: 50 });

    fetch(url, { agent: url.startsWith('https') ? httpsAgent : httpAgent });

  This should fix your leak!

  Implemented all fixes! Memory is now stable at ~200MB.
  Before it was growing to 2GB+ within an hour.

  The biggest impact was:
  1. Adding error handlers (caught 15% of jobs were failing silently!)
  2. Concurrency limit (was hitting 300+ concurrent at peak)
  3. Request timeouts (some API calls were hanging for 10+ minutes)

  Thanks for the systematic debugging approach!

  Excellent! Those error rates and hanging requests definitely explain
  the leak. Glad it's resolved.

  **Recommendations for monitoring:**
  - Alert on job failure rate > 5%
  - Track average job duration
  - Monitor heap size (alert if > 500MB for your workload)
  - Set up APM to catch future issues early

  Consider adding circuit breakers if the external API
  becomes unreliable - prevents cascading failures.
